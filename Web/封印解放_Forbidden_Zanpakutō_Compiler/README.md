# 封印解放 — Forbidden Zanpakutō Compiler

**Category:** Web

**Points:** 750

**Author:** ShadowEternity

## Description

After the Thousand-Year Blood War, the Kidō Corps deployed the Reiatsu Flow Recompiler (RFR) to restore ancient scrolls from the Hōōden sealed archives. The system adapted Urahara Kisuke's serialization concepts for spiritual data reconstruction.

During reconstruction of a forbidden manuscript, a dormant Zanpakutō spirit awakened within the compiler itself — 虚極の拘突 (Kyougoku no Kōtotsu).

Your mission: exploit the flawed spirit-thread protocol to manifest a phantom Zanpakutō, invoke its Bankai inside the RFR, and extract the sealed artifact.
