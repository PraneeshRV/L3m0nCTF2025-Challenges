## 🔮 Description

> *"The Multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little."*

The reality we know has shattered. You are currently free-falling through a loop of **16 fractured dimensions**.
The Scarlet Witch has scattered the fragments of the **Incantation of Restoration** across these instability points.

Each dimension is volatile and will collapse in mere seconds, throwing you into the next reality.
You must stabilize your perception, traverse the loop, and gather the fragments before you are lost in the void forever.

*Piece together the incantation. Restore the timeline.*
