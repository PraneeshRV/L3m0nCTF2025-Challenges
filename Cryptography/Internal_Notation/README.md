## Description

During analysis of a recovered transmission, investigators found an encrypted message accompanied by a short configuration note written in the operator’s internal shorthand.

The note was never meant to explain the device — only to record its state for someone already familiar with it.

Your task is to interpret the notation correctly, configure the cipher accordingly, and recover the original message.

Once recovered, submit the plaintext wrapped in the following format:

L3m0nCTF{RECOVERED_MESSAGE}

The recovered message contains only alphabetic characters.

Preserve word order exactly as recovered.
