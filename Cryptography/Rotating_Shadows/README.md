## Description

During an investigation, a damaged mechanical cipher device was recovered.
Most of its components were destroyed, but investigators noticed unusual markings etched into the casing:

“…the noise left vibrations about rotating gears underneath.”

A partially processed transmission was also recovered from the device’s memory.

Once recovered, submit the plaintext wrapped in the following format:

L3m0nCTF{RECOVEREDMESSAGE}

Recovered Notes

Among the debris, a torn sheet of paper contained the following handwritten line:

“Not Less Visible, but always rotating, gears under.”

No further documentation of the mechanism was found.
