## Description

You are robbing a time‑locked vault that syncs to three different time anchors:

A planetary clock that wraps every 365 units.
A starship engine cycle that wraps every 377 units.
A quantum beacon that wraps every 391 units.

The vault unlocks at a specific universal tick.

As per our archives, three systems saw different local times when it last opened:

Planetary log: “Day 142 of cycle 365”.
Engine log: “Tick 250 of cycle 377”.
Beacon log: “Pulse 73 of cycle 391”.

Give me the universal tick and wrap it in the standard flag format. L3m0nCTF{...}
