## Description

Target: larry lmn
The target is sloppy. They posted a link to their new project on one of their social media accounts. Locate the account, find the project source code, and recover the hidden location metadata. And not only that there is more to find out

We need two things:

The BSSID of the WiFi network.

The Total Bill amount found in the evidence.

Flag Format: L3m0nCTF{BSSID_TOTALBILL}

## Flag

```
L3m0nCTF{00:1A:2B:3E:4D:5A_494.72}
```
