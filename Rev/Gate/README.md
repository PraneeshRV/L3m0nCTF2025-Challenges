## Description

The Gate has been sealed since before the dawn of the UNIX epoch. Mad Scientist Rintaro has determined that the system rejects our modern timeline.
To breach the Gate, you must synchronize with the divergence point where it locked. Rintaro has traced the signal to the year 1967.
Find the time in the 1967 and breach the gate.
