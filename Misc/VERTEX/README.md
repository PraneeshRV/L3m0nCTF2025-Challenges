## Description

The ancient Graph Kingdom has fallen into chaos. Its vertices have split into factions, and no one remembers who belongs where.

As the first trial of the Chromatic Trilogy, you must restore order. Identify the divided. Reunite what was separated. Only then will the path forward reveal itself.
