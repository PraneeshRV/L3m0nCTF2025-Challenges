## Description

Hark, Tarnished. The Shattering has left but echoes. The Great Runes, vessels of power, are hidden in the web's void. Seek the fragments. Uncover the demigods' secrets. Solve the riddle of their fractured Order, and commit the sin that will unseal the Erdtree. Only then can you face what lies within.
