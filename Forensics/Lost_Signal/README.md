## Description

A photograph recovered from an astronaut’s EVA camera appears completely normal.
Mission logs suggest a final message was embedded into the image moments before communication was lost.

Standard steganography tools reveal nothing unusual.

One clue was recovered from the transmission metadata:

Seed = 739391


Recover the hidden message.
