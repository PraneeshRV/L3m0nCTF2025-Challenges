# The Cicada Archives

## Description

An old archive surfaced during a routine investigation.

It contains fragments of digital evidence collected from a forgotten system — documents, binaries, and captured network traffic. At first glance, nothing seems out of place. Everything looks ordinary.

But those who left this archive behind were careful. They did not hide things in plain sight — they hid them between the lines, inside noise, inside normality.

Your task is to reconstruct what was hidden and uncover the truth they wanted found.

Not everything will reveal itself immediately. Some things require patience. Others require you to look where nobody usually looks.
